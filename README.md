Game-Of-Denomination (GD)
=========================
It is a coin game with the following rules:

. There is pile of coins kept on the desk.

. Coins can be picked up only from the top of the pile.

. Every coin has some points

. The player who collects maximum points wins

. The first Player picks up 1 or 2 coins then second player has the choice of picking at most twice the number of coins
taken by first player.

. After every turn the player in the previous move can take twice as many coins as the previous player.

It is a challenging game and test your ability to think and calculate stuff. The game AI uses a DP algorithm to play against the user. Level 1 and Level 2 are easy. But Level 3 is difficult. Every stack generated by this game is unbaised and in worst case the game will end up in a tie if both the players play optimally.

The coins are only of some particular denomainations i.e. 25,50,75 and 100. This is the reason for the game to be called Game-Of-Denomination.
